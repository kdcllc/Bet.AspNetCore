## Install

```csharp
    dotnet add package Bet.Extensions.Logging
```

## Usage

Sometimes we need to have tracing information enable to see where the configuration details are loaded from.

```csharp

    new HostBuilder()
          .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, configBuilder) =>
          {
               configBuilder.Build().DebugConfigurations();
          }
```

In order for this library to work with Microsoft ApplicationInsights please register the workers within DI:

```csharp
            .ConfigureServices(services =>
                {
                    services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetryWorkerService();
                })
```
