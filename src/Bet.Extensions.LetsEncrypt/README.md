## Troubleshooting DNS Challenge Validation

### Querying TXT records

`nslookup` is the primary tool most people use to do DNS queries from Windows because it's installed by default and available on every Windows OS since basically forever.

```cmd
    C:\>nslookup -q=txt _acme-challenge.example.com.
```

**Don't forget the final `.` on the domain name.**

This is the basic command that will query your local DNS server. But it's usually wise to specifically query a public DNS resolver like Google (8.8.8.8) or CloudFlare (1.1.1.1) in case you're in a split-brain DNS environment. However, some businesses are starting to deploy firewalls that block outbound DNS requests like this. So make sure you are able to query a known good record before tearing your hair out troubleshooting the record you're having trouble with. Here's how to explicitly query an external resolver.

```cmd
    C:\>nslookup -q=txt _acme-challenge.example.com. 1.1.1.1
```

### Windows 10 flushing DNS

```cmd
    ipconfig /flushdns
```
