## Summary

This goal of this repo is to add support for Azure Blob Storage for ML.NET library.
It allows for monitoring of the models in Azure Storage and triggers the reload if a new model has been uploaded.
In the scenarios when ML.NET model generation is being generated out of process it is helpful to get notification to the consuming application about the need to reload the Model.
