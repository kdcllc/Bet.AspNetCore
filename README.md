> The second letter in the Hebrew alphabet is the ×‘ bet/beit. Its meaning is "house". In the ancient pictographic Hebrew it was a symbol resembling a tent on a landscape.

_Note: Pre-release packages are distributed via [feedz.io](https://f.feedz.io/kdcllc/bet-aspnetcore/nuget/index.json)._

This goal of this repo is to provide with a reusable functionality for developing Microservices with Docker and Kubernetes.
These libraries extend `Microsoft.Extensions` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore` namespaces accordingly.

2. [`Bet.AspNetCore.HealthChecks`](./src/Bet.Extensions.Hosting/) provides with HealthChecks for most common scenarios of the web application.
3. [`Bet.AspNetCore.Logging`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.Logging/) contains logging functionality for `AspNetCore` applications such as azure analyzer and AppInsight extends `Serilog`.
4. [`Bet.AspNetCore.ReCapture`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.ReCapture/) - a package for Google ReCapture.
5. [`Bet.AspNetCore.LetsEncrypt`](./src/Bet.Extensions.Hosting/) - enables SSL inside of docker container i.e. hosted in Azure Containers.
6. [`Bet.AspNetCore.Middleware`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.Middleware/)
7. [`Bet.AspNetCore.AzureStorage`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.AzureStorage/) - extends `AspNetCore` and enables usage of Azure Blob Storage, Queues, Tables with MSI identity or token.
8. [`Bet.AspNetCore.Jwt`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.Jwt/) - Provides a simple and a quick way to get started with JWT authentication for your app.
9. [`Bet.AspNetCore.ApiKeyAuthentication`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.ApiKeyAuthentication/) Provides with custom authentication for Web Apis with Query Url parameter or Header.

## Sample Applications

All of the sample applications are deployable to local Kubernetes Cluster.
1. [`Bet.AspNetCore.Sample`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.Sample/) - `AspNetCore` Web App with spam and sentiment prediction models based on ([ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning)). Utiizes the following libraries
    - [`Bet.Extensions.ML`](https://github.com/kdcllc/Bet.Extensions/tree/master/src/Bet.Extensions.ML/) - includes Machine Learning library around [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning).
    - [`Bet.Extensions.ML.Sentiment`](https://github.com/kdcllc/Bet.Extensions/tree/master/src/Bet.Extensions.ML.Sentiment/) - Sentiment self-contained prediction engine to be used with any DotNetCore applications.
    - [`Bet.Extensions.ML.Spam`](https://github.com/kdcllc/Bet.Extensions/tree/master/src/Bet.Extensions.ML.Spam/) - Spam self-contained prediction engine to be used with any DotNetCore applications.
    - [`Bet.Extensions.HealthChecks.ML`](https://github.com/kdcllc/Bet.Extensions/tree/master/src/Bet.Extensions.HealthChecks.ML/) provides with HealthChecks ML.NET Models.
    - [`Bet.Extensions.ML.Azure`](https://github.com/kdcllc/Bet.Extensions/tree/master/src/Bet.Extensions.ML.Azure/) provides with extensions methods for Azure Blob Storage Model monitoring and reload.


2. [`Bet.K8s.Web.Sample`](./src/Bet.K8s.Web.Sample/) - `AspNetCore` Web App with spam and sentiment prediction models.
3. [`LetsEncryptWeb`](./src/LetsEncryptWeb/) - `AspNetCore` Web App with spam and sentiment prediction models.

## `DotNetCore` CLI global tools

1. [AppAuthentication](https://github.com/kdcllc/AppAuthentication) - enables Microsoft Managed Identity (MSI) testing `Azure Key Vault` or `Azure Blob Storage` access from Docker Container in Local development based on token authentication.
   ![AppAuthentication](./img/appauthentication-docker-debug.gif)

```bash
    # adds local tool manifest file
    dotnet new tool-manifest

    # install appauthentication local version
    dotnet tool install appauthentication
```
