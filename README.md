> The second letter in the Hebrew alphabet is the ×‘ bet/beit. Its meaning is "house". In the ancient pictographic Hebrew it was a symbol resembling a tent on a landscape.

*Note: Pre-release packages are distributed via [feedz.io](https://f.feedz.io/kdcllc/bet-aspnetcore/nuget/index.json).*

This goal of this repo is to provide with a reusable functionality for developing Microservices with Docker and Kubernetes.
These libraries extend `Microsoft.Extensions` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore` namespaces accordingly.

4. [`Bet.AspNetCore.ReCapture`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.ReCapture/) - a package for Google ReCapture.
5. [`Bet.AspNetCore.LetsEncrypt`](./src/Bet.Extensions.Hosting/) - enables SSL inside of docker container i.e. hosted in Azure Containers.
6. [`Bet.AspNetCore.Middleware`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.Middleware/)
7. [`Bet.AspNetCore.AzureStorage`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.AzureStorage/) - extends `AspNetCore` and enables usage of Azure Blob Storage, Queues, Tables with MSI identity or token.

## Sample Applications

All of the sample applications are deployable to local Kubernetes Cluster.

1. [`Bet.AspNetCore.Sample`](./src/Bet.AspNetCore.Sample/) - `AspNetCore` Web App with spam and sentiment prediction models.
2. [`Bet.Hosting.Sample`](./src/Bet.Hosting.Sample/) - DotNetCore Worker App that can run in Kubernetes as CronJob.
